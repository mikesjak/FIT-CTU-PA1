# Finding maximum linked list

## What to do?

- Create a function that finds maximum in an array of Linked lists.
- Each linked list represents a number (shown in 'Basic showcase').
- Find linked list with the biggest number and return it.

## Basic showcase

- Assert are in the code.

#### How are the numbers represented?

1. Linked list 1->2->3->4->5 is 54321
2. Linked list 1->0->0->0 is 1
3. Linked list 0->0->0->1->0->0->0 is 1000
4. Linked list 0->0->0->1 is 1000
<br />
- If these for were in an array, you would return a[0] (first linked list)
- Remember to return a pointer to the head of the linked list
- If you want to create your own input, you have to create new asserts.
